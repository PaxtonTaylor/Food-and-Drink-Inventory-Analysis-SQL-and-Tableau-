# Food-and-Drink-Inventory-Analysis-SQL-and-Tableau-
This is the first project from the Analytics Mentor program by Brandon Southern

## Introduction

For this project, I created 3 tables to track inventories and product information for foods and drinks in SQL.
The primary use of this data is to see what items we have in our grocery store and what the inventory is for those items.

This is an example of my SQL skills and how I use them to create, investigate, aggregate, join, and pull data from this database.


## Data
The data used for this is downloaded from the Analytics Mentor Program by Brandon Southern.
It was available only as .csv files.

The original files listed below are available for download in the file secion of this repository:

- foods.csv
- drinks.csv
- food_inventories


## Tools

- SQL - PostgresSQL
- Data Visualization - Tableau (will add at a later time)
- Some Excel to setup tables and basic exploratory analysis
